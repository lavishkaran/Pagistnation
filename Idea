material easily, free of cost. Teachers will be paid and if students will upload their notrs, they will also paid for that.
Challenges:
Competition is betwwen may others and more likely with NPTEL. But they are providing notes for mostly IITs and NITs and not for other colleges. But this application will provide
notes and study material for students of others colleges also.
In starting many teachers will disagree with us for sharing their notes might be for sny reason, student will ask why they should choose Pagistnation only, why not NPTEL or
anything else.
Problems:
Reaching diffrent colleges of diffrent part of country.
Asking Principal for getting permission and time for conduction seminars or webinars.
Collabrating with diffrent colleges.
